The world's most hated IT stickers

![An assortment of various logos that look like other famous brands but actually have their competitors' name](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EC5sIScWkAIUSen?format=png&name=900x900)

(there's more!)

Inspired by Sam Beckham's legendary [JavaScript sticker]( https://samdbeckham.gitlab.io/javascript_sticker/)

## FAQ: 

#### Can I print these?
Of course, that's why those are here.

#### Can I buy these?
Yes, you can! Not from me, but from any custom sticker vendor of your choice.

#### Will there be more?
This is a fork of the original repo that hadn't been updated in some time. I'm
working on adding new logos that were submitted as pull requests to the original
repo.

Anyone is also welcome to submit new pull requests to this repo directly.

#### TODO
- [-] Finish importing pull requests
- [ ] Naming conventions
